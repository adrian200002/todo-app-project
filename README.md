React Todo-App Project.

Description : I created a React-based Todo App that allows users to add, remove, mark as completed, and filter todos.
The application features reusable components, enhancing code modularity and maintainability.
Users can efficiently manage their tasks through a clean and intuitive user interface.

Key Features:

Add, remove, and mark todos as completed.
User-friendly interface for easy task management.
Filtering options to organize todos based on their status.
Dynamic fetching of todo data from an external API.
